<!-- is like a translator that allows two programs to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge between the client (the program making the request, such as your mobile app) and the server (the program providing the response, such as a weather bureauâ€™s database). This allows apps to retrieve data or perform operations without knowing the internal workings of the server -->
